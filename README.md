# CryptoEye

A tag can be one of the following items:
* Cryptocurrency symbols like BTC, ETH, etc.

**_CryptoEye_** comprises the following features:
* Showing a tag list screen with a search bar, and displaying the search results on the same page.
* Saving the tags locally, and synchronizing them with the server during each app launch.
* Proper error handling.
* Proposing recent search queries.
